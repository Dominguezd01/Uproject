Hi! ðŸ‘‹

Uproject is a trello clone made in Svelte for my final project.

This is just the front end of the app but you can find the backend here https://github.com/Dominguezd01/UprojectBackend.

The goal is to make this app free when itÂ´s done, if you would like to do your own UI you can implement it without thinking of a backend.

And...thatÂ´s all for today, IÂ´ll keep you posted on my progress, see you soon ðŸ«¡
